1.  Overview of the film
2.  What is knowledge?
3.  What is personal identity?

## Overview of the film

Write in chat a one-line summary of the plot of TOTAL RECALL

(A good one :P).

---


The film considers issues about:

* Our knowledge of reality.
* Our personal identity.

Though they are not quite the same; one depends on the other.

{{% alert note %}}
The film makes use of a skeptical scenario in order to make a point about identity.

Skepticism, in TOTAL RECALL, is not an end in itself; it is a means for another philosophical claims.

- Though not quite as secondary as in THE MATRIX, skepticism in TOTAL RECALL plays second fiddle to the main topic of identity.

To consider these topics we will first talk about an important question in philosophy: What is knowledge?

## Knowledge

Consider the following clip from the film:

<div style="padding:54.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/673818061?h=a7cadd3a05&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="TR4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>


> "You're not here."


At this point in the film, is Doug *justified* in trusting Dr. Edgemar?

What is the *rational* thing for Doug to believe about the experiences he has had between Recall and his meeting Dr. Edgemar?

Compare this to the scene in THE MATRIX where Neo is also offered a red pill as a way out.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="5437251" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.83824" data-width="100%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/the-matrix-choose-pill-gif-5437251">Blue Pill Red Pill Choose GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/the+matrix-gifs">The Matrix GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

Doug refuses to accept what he is being told. Neo accepts what he is being told. 

Who is correct? **Neither**. But why? They both act upon belief that stops short of knowledge.


### Believing something ≠ knowing something

Consider a multiple choice exam where you have given an answer to all the questions but where you only know the answer to the first half. What is the difference?

1.  The answers from knowledge are certainly **TRUE**. The other answers *might* be false or true.
2.  The answers from knowledge are certainly true and **JUSTIFIED**. Even if the other answers happen to be true, you have no proper warrant that they are true.
3. They were not by chance. 

- Knowledge entails Truth: to know something is to know something true.
- Knowledge entails Justification: to know something is to know something for which one has justification   
- Knowledge is not by chance: to know something is to know in a way that is not just product of luck.

### What is knowledge?


**K = JTB**

**K**nowledge is **J**ustified **T**rue **B**elief

It is not possible for us to completely cover the details of this account. But we can get a good enough idea of each element.

### Belief

What is it to believe something?

That is a hard question. There are several theoretical accounts of belief. For the moment it will be important for us to talk about *direction of fit*

**believing something ≠ desiring something** 

Think about the difference of a piece of paper with a list of items where it is meant to be a description of what you have bought from the store and when it is meant to be a prescription of what you ought to buy from the store. 
- Belief has mind<-world direction of fit: belief answers to how the world is. 
- Desire has a world<-mind direction of fit: the world (is expected to) answer to how the mind is. 

To believe is to the mental attitude of taking up something as true.

### True belief

What is it to believe truly?

Another tough one.

> To say that what is is not, or that what is not is, is false; but to say that what is is, and what is not is not, is true; and therefore also he who says that a thing is or is not will say either what is true or what is false. Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1011 b


### Justified true belief

What is it to believe truly and with justification?

Justification implies *reason*. Not merely happening to be a in a true cognitive state but rather to have a reason in support.

---

The JTB account does not quite work as a characterization of knowledge because of the Gettier cases.

### Gettier cases

Edmund Gettier (1963) in "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?""

1.  Smith is told by the CEO of the company that Jones will get the job.  
    Smith believes so.
2.  Smith sees that Jones has ten coins in his pocket.  
    Smith believes so.
3.  Smith infers that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket.  
    Smith believes so. Call this the G belief
4.  Unbeknownst to Smith he gets the job and he has ten coins in his pocket.
5.  The G belief is true.
6.  The G belief is justified.
7.  The G belief is not knowledge.

There have been several attempts to describe further conditions on knowledge in order to respond to Gettier's challenge.

### K = true, sensitive and safe belief.

(1) p is true.  
(2) S believes that p.  
(3) If p were false, S would not believe that p (sensitivity)  
(4) If S were to believe that p, p would not be false. (safety).

The counterfactuals are key in this view. How are we to understand, for example, with the case of mathematical knowledge?

### Simple Causal Theory of Knowledge:

S knows that p iff p is true;  
S believes that p;  
S’s belief that p is caused by the fact that p.  

This leaves behind complicated cases where it might be true that a fact causes but, because of deviant causal chains, there is, at least intuitively, reason to believe there is no knowledge. 


### Knowledge as primitive

Another possible answer is to reject the question: 

We should not attempt to understand knowledge in terms of belief plus something else. Rather, we should attempt to understand justification and belief, for example, in terms of knowledge. Knowledge is that in terms of which we explain all other epistemological notions. 



## What is personal identity?


The questions about knowledge help us see the questions about identity. 

###  Is Doug right in believing Lori?

> "Your whole life is just a dream."

Who is Hauser and who is Doug? Is it possible for two people to "share" the same body?

At this point, does Doug _know_ that he is not married to Lori?


###  Is Doug right in believing Hauser?

Watch the following clip from the film.

<div style="padding:54.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/673815921?h=5acd442f25&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="TR2"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

> "I've been playing for the wrong team"

- Is Doug right in believing Hauser?

- At this point in the film, does Doug _know_ that he knows what is necessary to take Cohaagen down?

- At this point in the film, is Doug justified in trusting Hauser? Should he take a strange instrument and shove it up his nose?

Watch the following clip from the film.

<div style="padding:54.17% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/673815639?h=8118b82804&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="TR3"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

> "It's my body you have here."


Set aside the moral issues involved in Hauser's plan, assume it wasn't evil. Were you in Hauser's position, would you erase your memories in order to carry out your plans?

- If you could wake up tomorrow having finished your degree, without having sent your own "Doug" to do it, would you do it? 

- Is Doug *Doug*? Or is he really Hauser?

There are several ways to answer

- Same psychology? Same person. So?

- Same living being? Same person. So?

- Same actions? Same person. So?

## Task

### Short video

We have been talking about knowledge without giving any characterization of it. Think about a moment in your life when you thought you knew something ABOUT YOURSELF but found out you didn't? What were you missing in order to know? Had you had _that_ before, would you have had knowledge?
