## Plan

1.  Film overview
2.  The future

## Film overview


Write in chat a one-line summary of the plot of MINORITY REPORT.

(A good one :P).

The film considers several questions. One is about free will and determination. Another about time. 

> The film assumes view about time in order to make a point about choice.


Is Anderton's choice a good one? (Compare to Neo, Doug and Truman)

> The film assumes view about time in order to make a point about choice.

There is a difference between "Is Anderton's choice a good one?" and "Is Anderton's choice *possible*?"

## The future

The precogs "see" the future and the police stop it. Is it still the future if it is stopped?

### The A-series and the B-series

What is time?  Two general views: The A-series and the B-series (McTaggart)
<a href="https://ibb.co/28SQpd8"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tZzt1DZ/time.png" alt="time" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://ibb.co/2sgrbg0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tx86d8w/time2.png" alt="time2" border="0" /></a>

We will come back to time later in the semester. 

For the moment we just need to bear in mind that there is one metaphysics of time that is assumed by the film.

Watch the scene again and answer: What views of the metaphysics of time are compatible with the film?

## Responsibility and agency


### Human agency


Things happen in the world; Humans act in the world. What, if any, is the difference?

One view: Humans are not determined by past events.  
Everything else is.  
Another view: Humans are determined by past events just like everything else.

Which view are you inclined to accept?

### Intention

What is the difference between what we will do and what we merely intend to do?

One view: To intend to X is to believe one will X.  
Another view: To intend to X is a *sui generis* mental state.

### Responsibility


We can talk about many kinds of responsibility. But in the following, talk about responsibility will be about *moral* responsibility.

The film invites us to think about the difference between two questions:

- Are you responsible for your future actions?

- Are you responsible for your future actions even if you are stopped from doing them?

Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) are responsible for it and 2) can stop it.
{{% /alert %}}

The main claim goes against the principle of alternative possibilities: (**PAP**) an agent is morally responsible for performing a given act A only if they could have done otherwise.

Do you agree with **PAP**?

Often, the argument in favor of PAP goes like this: When we are coerced into doing X we are not responsible. (Examples?) *Therefore*, alternative ways of acting should be available. Thus: **PAP**. 

Does this support **PAP**?

Harry Frankfurt: No! There are cases when someone will do X no matter what and yet we do hold them responsible.

1.  Jones 1 is an unreasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does not attend to it. He goes on to do what he had previously decided. Incidentaly, he does what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he decided so.
2.  Jones 2 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he was threatened so.
3.  Jones 3 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided to do. He did X fully because he decided so.
4.  Jones 4 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided. He did X partly because he decided so, partly because he was threatened.

Frankfurt's point is that even if we couldn't have acted otherwise we might be responsible. We are only free of blame if we only acted so *because* of force.


Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) are responsible for it and 2) can stop it.

Knowing what we are going to do makes the difference.

What is the difference between the Frankfurt argument and the Minority's report argument?
