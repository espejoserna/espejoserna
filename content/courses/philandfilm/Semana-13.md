## Film overview


Write in chat a one-line summary of the plot of NETWORK.

(A good one).

  <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l41YdsBZC6Im0L8cM" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

The technical aspects of the film are dated; the personal aspects are spot on.

### The claim

Network shows one way in which considerations about value may go.

Network shows us the change in values in the news.

The worry is not that they change truth for lies; rather it is that whether true or false does not matter. The scale changes.

  


## Conspiracy against the news?


"A conspiracy theory is an explanation of some alleged fact or event in terms of the actions undertaken by a small group of individuals working in secret."

Does the film present a conspiracy _against_ the news?

### Conspiracy theories

Conspiracy theories are sometimes true (Watergate); they are sometimes reasonable to accept. But when?

There is no recipe. There is no single way to determine. But we can be wary of how they are meant to work.

Cassam suggests that it is because of vice of the mind.

Ej: singlemindedness or intelectual pride

Does the film present a conspiracy against the news?

No

What then?



## Ratings, news and entertainment


The film does not show a conspiracy to destroy the news or change it from the root. There is however an attack on the news. Let me show you what kind of attack I mean.

### Slow change in values


One might be tempted to think first and foremost of values as moral values. But the notion of value is more general and is best explained by other means.

Example: values in a football match

If winning is the main aim of football, what has value is whatever gets us closer to such aim.

What is the main aim of a news show?

We value what gets us closer to achieving that aim

It seems the question wears the answer on its sleeves: the main functions of a newscast is to communicate the news.

We have ratings to judge how good a newscast show is: ratings meassure the amount of people that keep on watching and thus the people who get what they want, that is, the news.

Why are ratings used to judge a show?

**Proxies**

When we cannot meassure X but we know that it correlates with a variable Y that be meassured we use Y as a proxy for X.

Examples?

The problem with proxies is that they can foster perverse incentives. One can maximize a proxy without caring for the original aim. The proxy stops being a proxy.

Example: change of values in a football match: recognition instead of goals

The film show the change of values in the news.

Instead of news, the aim is ratings.

The means (ratings) become the ends.

(Kant already warned us about a version of this problema

  


## Grades, learning and entertainment


I want to further explain the problems of changes in values in an example that is closer to us.

Grades, learning and entertainment

Act I: Instructors and students value learning.

Act II: Instructors and students value grades as a proxy for learning.

Act III: Instructors and students change their values from learning to grades.

Act IV: :(

Probably: we have all been, from time to time, sucked into caring for grades above learning.

examples?

The film shows us the dangers of mixing news and entertainment. What are the dangers of mixing learning and entertainment?

Gamification: "learning through a game". Examples?

Instructors are bombarded with the following: "No motivation to study? Low grades? Learning problems? Make learning fun."

The assumption behind gamification is that learning should be valued in terms of fun (at best as a proxy for learning). Why?

### Entertainment

Learning should not be fun. (?)

It should not be boring either. (?)

This is the wrong scale.

If we care about grades then we see gamification as good thing: it gets us closer to our ends.

If we care about learning we might see gamification as a bad thing: it changes the value scale.
