## Course content

### Main aims

The main aim of this course is to develop language skills in academic English while at the same time studying philosophical problems through film. This merits two clarifications.


1) This is not an English class

Our main concern will not be Shakespeare’s tongue but rather the peculiar hybrid that communities of academics around the globe speak and write in and what we will be calling ‘academic English’.


2) Philosophy *through* films


Not philosophy *of* art, where the topic is cinema in general; rather: any kind of philosophical point made \***through**\* film

Our main activity will be the discussion of philosophical questions through the discussion of films. I hope this will give those of you who are not philosophers a way into philosophy and open a different approach to those of you already familiar with philosophy.

We philosophize with the help of our community, a group of people that includes a vast philosophical tradition, our students, teachers and peers. No philosopher is an island.

Though philosophy in contemporary centres of learning tends to be done through reflection upon the written word, in this course, we will consider how specific films put forward philosophical theses for our consideration and how philosophy can be done through them.

Our main sources for philosophical discussion will be 1) a specific film, 2) a short introductory text and 3) short audio interviews with contemporary philosophers

### Any questions?
