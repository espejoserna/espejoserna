<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;"> Film overview</h2>

</section>

<section>


Write in chat a one-line summary of the plot of NETWORK.

(A good one).

<section>

The technical aspects of the film are dated; the personal aspects are spot on.

</section>

<section>

Main claim: Network shows one way in which considerations about value may go.
it shows us the change in values in the news.


</section>

<section>

It is a worry about truth
</section>

<section>


But this worry is not that they change truth for lies; rather it is that whether true or false does not matter. The _scale_ changes.

Let me explain.
  
</section>

<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Conspiracy against the news</h2>

</section>

<section>



"A conspiracy theory is an explanation of some alleged fact or event in terms of the actions undertaken by a small group of individuals working in secret."

Does the film present a conspiracy _against_ the news?
</section>

<section>


Conspiracy theories are sometimes true (Watergate). And thus they are sometimes reasonable to accept. But when?

</section>

<section>

There is no recipe. There is no single way to determine when not to believe. But we can be wary of how they are meant to work.

</section>

<section>

Cassam suggests that conspiracy theories work because of vice of the mind.

</section>

<section>

Vices like singlemindedness or intelectual pride. Examples?

</section>

<section>

Does the film present a conspiracy against the news?

</section>

<section>

I don't think so. What then?

</section>

<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Ratings, news and entertainment
</h2>

</section>

<section>

The film does not show a conspiracy to destroy the news or change it from the root. There is however an attack on the news. Let me show you what kind of attack I mean.

</section>

<section>

The attack is a slow change in values

</section>

<section>


One might be tempted to think first and foremost of values as moral values. But the notion of value is more general and is best explained by other means.

</section>

<section>

Example: values in a football match

If winning is the main aim of football, whatever gets us closer to such aim has value.

</section>

<section>


What is the main aim of a news show?

We value what gets us closer to achieving that aim

</section>

<section>


It seems the question wears the answer on its sleeves: the main functions of a newscast is to communicate the news.

</section>

<section>


We have ratings to judge how good a newscast show is: ratings meassure the amount of people that keep on watching and thus the people who get what they want, that is, the news.

</section>

<section>


Why are ratings used to judge a show?

</section>

<section>


**Proxies**


</section>

<section>


When we cannot meassure X but we know that it correlates with a variable Y that be meassured we use Y as a proxy for X.

Examples?

</section>

<section>


The problem with proxies is that they can foster perverse incentives. One can maximize a proxy without caring for the original aim. The proxy stops being a proxy.

Example: change of values in a football match: recognition instead of goals

</section>

<section>


The film show the change of values in the news.

</section>

<section>


Instead of news, the aim becomes ratings. The means (ratings) become the ends.

(Kant already warned us about a version of this problema

<h2 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000;">Grades, learning and entertainment

</h2>


</section>

<section>

  


I want to further explain the problems of changes in values in an example that is closer to us: Grades, learning and entertainment


</section>

<section>



Act I: Instructors and students value learning.

</section>

<section>

Act II: Instructors and students value grades as a proxy for learning.

</section>

<section>

Act III: Instructors and students change their values from learning to grades.

</section>

<section>

Act IV:  Sad ending.

</section>

<section>

Probably: we have all been, from time to time, sucked into caring for grades above learning.

examples?

</section>

<section>

The film shows us the dangers of mixing news and entertainment. What are the dangers of mixing learning and entertainment?

</section>

<section>

Gamification: "learning through a game". Examples?

</section>

<section>

Instructors are bombarded with the following: "No motivation to study? Low grades? Learning problems? Make learning fun."

</section>

<section>

The assumption behind gamification is that learning should be valued in terms of fun (at best as a proxy for learning). Why?



</section>

<section>

Entertainment?

</section>

<section>


> Learning should not be fun; It should not be boring either. 

What do you think?


</section>

<section>


This is the wrong scale.

</section>

<section>

If we care about grades then we see gamification as good thing: it gets us closer to our ends.

If we care about learning we might see gamification as a bad thing: it changes the value scale.
