The film considers several questions. One is about free will and determination. Another about time. </section> 
<section>
  


> The film assumes view about time in order to make a point about choice.
</section> 
<section>
  


Is Anderton's choice a good one? (Compare to Neo, Doug and Truman)

</section> 
<section>
  

> The film assumes view about time in order to make a point about choice.

There is a difference between "Is Anderton's choice a good one?" and "Is Anderton's choice *possible*?"

### Main claim

The precogs "see" the future and the police stop it. Is it still the future if it is stopped?

### The A-series and the B-series

What is time?  Two general views: The A-series and the B-series (McTaggart)

<section>
  

We will come back to time later in the semester. 
</section> 
<section>
  

For the moment we just need to bear in mind that there is *some* metaphysics of time that is assumed by the film.
</section> 
<section>
  

Watch the scene again and answer: What views of the metaphysics of time are compatible with the film?

## Responsibility and agency

</section> 
<section>
  

### Human agency

</section> 
<section>
  

Things happen in the world; Humans act in the world. What, if any, is the difference?
</section> 
<section>
  

One view: 
- Humans are not determined by past events.  
- Everything else is.  

</section> 
<section>
  

Another view: 
- Humans are determined by past events just like everything else.

</section> 
<section>
  

Which view are you inclined to accept?
</section> 
<section>
  

### Intention
</section> 
<section>
  

What is the difference between what we will do and what we merely intend to do?
</section> 
<section>
  

- One view: To intend to X is to believe one will X.  
- Another view: To intend to X is a *sui generis* mental state.
</section> 
<section>
  

### Responsibility

</section> 
<section>
  

We can talk about many kinds of responsibility. But in the following, talk about responsibility will be about *moral* responsibility. (not legal, not conventional.)

</section> 
<section>
  


The film invites us to think about the difference between two questions:
</section> 
<section>
  

- Are you responsible for your future actions?

- Are you responsible for your future actions even if you are stopped from doing them?
</section> 
<section>
  

{{% alert note %}}
Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) are responsible for it and 2) can stop it.
{{% /alert %}}
</section> 
<section>
  

The main claim goes against the principle of alternative possibilities: (**PAP**) an agent is morally responsible for performing a given act A only if they could have done otherwise.

Do you agree with **PAP**?
</section> 
<section>
  

Often, the argument in favor of PAP goes like this: 
- When we are coerced into doing X we are not responsible. (Examples?) 
- *Therefore*, alternative ways of acting should be available. 
- Thus: **PAP**. 

Does this support **PAP**?
</section> 
<section>
  

Harry Frankfurt: No! There are cases when someone will do X no matter what and yet we do hold them responsible.
</section> 
<section>

1. Jones 1 is an unreasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does not attend to it. He goes on to do what he had previously decided. Incidentaly, he does what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he decided so.

2.  Jones 2 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he was threatened so.

3.  Jones 3 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided to do. He did X fully because he decided so.

4.  Jones 4 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided. He did X partly because he decided so, partly because he was threatened.

</small>
</section> 
<section>
  

Frankfurt's point is that even if we couldn't have acted otherwise we might be responsible. We are only free of blame if we only acted so *because* of force.

</section> 

<section>
  
Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) are responsible for it and 2) can stop it.

<section>
  


The film assumes that knowing what we are going to do makes the difference.
</section> 
<section>
  

What is the difference between Frankfurt's argument and Minority Report's argument?
