<p>Write a one-line summary of the plot of Gattaca.</p>

<section>
<p>The film considers several questions with philosophical importance. One is about free will and determination. Another about merit.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<h3 id="main-claim">Main claim</h3>
<p>The film assumes a view about determination in order to make a point about merit.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Is Vince worthy of the being an astronaut?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) can fight it and 2) deserve to win.</p>
</section>

<p>If you really want to X, we can X. (If you cannot X, is because you really didn&rsquo;t want it enough).</p>

<p>ANTONIO: We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GENETICIST: You want to give your child the best possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already. Your child doesn&rsquo;t need any additional burdens. And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.</p>

Think about the following game of chance.
<p>Select a number of coins, shake them in your hands and count heads.</p>

<p>Announce your total amount. You win if you got the most heads.</p>

<li>Was the game fair?</li>

<h2 id="is-better-always-good">Is &ldquo;better&rdquo; always good?</h2>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Unlike the other films we have seen, the scenario presented by this film might not present itself as unjust.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Vince was unlucky; Anton was lucky. Neither is being shown as unjust.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>It seems that people in the film aimed at <em>improving</em> themselves. They aimed at getting better. Some people might be worse off but it is a matter of <em>chance</em>.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>If improvement is a matter of chance, is improving your chances always good? never? sometimes?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Several people endorse a version of utilitarianism, with some variations. So it is helpful to think about the kind of answers it would give.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Is improving your chances always good?</p>
<p>Utilitarian: Absolutely (ish).</p>

<p>Utilitarians think that better is always good. If society at large is better off, it will be good.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Let me tell you the story of Jim1, Jim2 and Jim3.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Jim1: Jim, a botanist comes upon a public execution in a small town. A military captain has lined up twenty people. He explains to Jim that they have been chosen at random from the local population, which has recently been protesting against the government. The captain offers Jim a guest’s privilege. If Jim wishes, he can select one of them and shoot him; the other nineteen will then go free. Otherwise, the execution by the captain’s henchman, Pedro, will go ahead as planned. What should Jim do?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Jim2: Because the captain suspects him of involvement, Jim2 is asked to commit suicide to save the 20 people. What should Jim do?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Jim3: Jim3 has lived in the area for some time and has developed a deep and lasting personal relationship with one of the townspeople. The captain, knowing of this, sadistically offers Jim a choice: either he shoots that people and the other nineteen will go free, or the other nineteen will be shot and his friend will be freed. What should Jim do?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Is improving the conditions of the many always good?</p>
<p>Think about COVID-19 and how questions about the many and the few are involved.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Is &ldquo;better&rdquo; always good? Is it <em>neutral</em>? Is neutrality and randomness good?</p>
