<p>The film considers several questions. One is about free will and determination. Another about time. </section></p>

<p>The film assumes view about time in order to make a point about choice.</p>

<p>We will come back to time later in the semester.</p>

<section>
<p>For the moment we just need to bear in mind that there is <em>some</em> metaphysics of time that is assumed by the film.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Watch the scene again and answer: What views of the metaphysics of time are compatible with the film?</p>

<h3 id="human-agency">Human agency</h3>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Things happen in the world; Humans act in the world. What, if any, is the difference?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>One view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans are not determined by past events.</li>
<li>Everything else is.</li>
</ul>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Another view:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans are determined by past events just like everything else.</li>
</ul>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Which view are you inclined to accept?</p>

<h3 id="intention">Intention</h3>
</section> 
<section>
<p>What is the difference between what we will do and what we merely intend to do?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<ul>
<li>One view: To intend to X is to believe one will X.</li>
<li>Another view: To intend to X is a <em>sui generis</em> mental state.</li>
</ul>
</section> 
<section>
<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>
</section> 
<section>
<p>We can talk about many kinds of responsibility. But in the following, talk about responsibility will be about <em>moral</em> responsibility. (not legal, not conventional.)</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>The film invites us to think about the difference between two questions:</p>
</section> 
<section>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you responsible for your future actions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you responsible for your future actions even if you are stopped from doing them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>

    Main claim: The film defends the view that even if we are determined to do something we 1) are responsible for it and 2) can stop it.
  </div>
</div>
</section> 
<section>
<p>The main claim goes against the principle of alternative possibilities: (<strong>PAP</strong>) an agent is morally responsible for performing a given act A only if they could have done otherwise.</p>
<p>Do you agree with <strong>PAP</strong>?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Often, the argument in favor of PAP goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we are coerced into doing X we are not responsible. (Examples?)</li>
<li><em>Therefore</em>, alternative ways of acting should be available.</li>
<li>Thus: <strong>PAP</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this support <strong>PAP</strong>?</p>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Harry Frankfurt: No! There are cases when someone will do X no matter what and yet we do hold them responsible.</p>
</section> 
<section>
<small>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jones 1 is an unreasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does not attend to it. He goes on to do what he had previously decided. Incidentaly, he does what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he decided so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jones 2 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he was threatened to do. He did X fully because he was threatened so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jones 3 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided to do. He did X fully because he decided so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jones 4 is a reasonable man; he receives a credible threat and does attends to it. He goes on to do what he had decided. He did X partly because he decided so, partly because he was threatened.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</small>
</section> 
<section>
<p>Frankfurt&rsquo;s point is that even if we couldn&rsquo;t have acted otherwise we might be responsible. We are only free of blame if we only acted so <em>because</em> of force.</p>
